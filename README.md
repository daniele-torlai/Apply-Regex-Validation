Apply Regex Validation custom control is the Regex based field validation for text fields.

# Instructions to use:

2. Open the Form Editor for the desired form of the required entity, select the field supported by this control *(SingleLine.Text, SingleLine.Phone, SingleLine.Email)* and click *"Change Properties"* and then select the *"Controls"* tab.
3. In the Controls tab, click the *"Add Control..."* button, select *"Apply Regex Validation"* in the list of available controls and click *"Add"*.\

9. Save settings of the custom control, save and publish the entity form.


# Control Behaviour:
1. On change of field value, if the value in the field doesn't satisfies the Regex, notification will be on field.\

2. On save of record, if the error notification on field exists, notification will be on top of form as well(OOB behaviour).\
